### 🌍 Overview
A bandwidth-efficient **multi-robot cooperative SLAM system** for large-scale exploration.  
Robots exchange **2.5D submaps** under bandwidth-limited communication and achieve global consistency via a **sliding window optimizer**.  

**Key Features:**
- 📡 Low-bandwidth 2.5D submap communication  
- 🧭 Sliding window optimization for global consistency  
- 🤝 Collaborative mapping in distributed environments  

### 📊 Results
- Reduced communication by **>30%** compared with 3D submaps  
- Achieved robust mapping in real-world multi-robot experiments

## 🚁 Project: Autonomous UAV Inspection System for Bridge Monitoring
**Duration:** Aug. 2024 – Nov. 2024  
**Role:** Independent Developer  

### 🌍 Overview
This project implements an **autonomous UAV inspection system** designed for bridge monitoring tasks. The system enables a single drone to perform fully autonomous takeoff, multi-waypoint navigation, and precise localization along the bridge.  

### 🛠 Platform
- UAV equipped with **RTK, Livox Mid360 LiDAR, and Realsense D435**  
- Onboard processor: **Intel NUC**  
- Operating system: **Ubuntu 20.04**  

### 📌 Key Features

1. **Bridge Modeling:**  
   - Real-time **RTK + LIO** for initial localization  
   - Construct a matched-frame database and save high-precision bridge point cloud models  

2. **Relocalization:**  
   - Extract keyframe point cloud descriptors and match them with the database  
   - Use **iSAM** for factor graph optimization to obtain accurate UAV poses  

3. **Multi-Waypoint Navigation:**  
   - Developed a **multi-waypoint selection plugin in Rviz**  
   - Designed a **global planner** to select navigation points online based on the bridge model  

### 📊 Results
- UAV successfully performed **autonomous takeoff and multi-point navigation**  
- Relocalization error: **< 0.1 m**  
- Mission success rate: **> 95%**
